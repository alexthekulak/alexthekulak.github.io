 American Compass is one of those think tanks that has excited a number of my friends. In particular, for those of my friends who have become market-skeptic but remain on the right, this think tank holds a certain promise. It holds the promise, one might argue, of providing a reasonable excuse of making the tough choices that don&rsquo;t align with the market consensus.</p></div>

    <div class="post-content"><div class="p_part"><p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of talk recently about the minimum wage in the US, and for good reason- the CBO released a new report on the Raise the Wage Act of 2021 that I highly recommend everyone take a look at. I will also be the first to admit that I&rsquo;m neither a labor economist nor a macroeconomist more generally, but I wanted to add a few comments to the discussion on a variety of matters.</p></div>

    <div class="post-content"><div class="p_part"><p>I&rsquo;m going to tell a story, and you can decide if it in any way sounds familiar to you. There is a group of people living in a society without nobility, so this society decides that they&rsquo;re going to focus a lot on formal credentials. These specific people are part of a cultural minority, and they know this. As a result of this, they realize that they lack any real chance of being the majority in the most elite universities that grant the most prestigious credentials.</p></div>

    <div class="post-content"><div class="p_part"><p>The proper exercise of personal freedom requires specific conditions of an economic, social, juridic, political and cultural order that “are too often disregarded or violated. Such situations of blindness and injustice injure the moral life and involve the strong as well as the weak in the temptation to sin against charity. By deviating from the moral law man violates his own freedom, becomes imprisoned within himself, disrupts neighbourly fellowship and rebels against divine truth.</p></div>

    <div class="post-content"><div class="p_part"><p>The Church&rsquo;s social doctrine is not a &ldquo;third way&rdquo; between liberal capitalism and Marxist collectivism, nor even a possible alternative to other solutions less radically opposed to one another: rather, it constitutes a category of its own. Nor is it an ideology, but rather the accurate formulation of the results of a careful reflection on the complex realities of human existence, in society and in the international order, in the light of faith and of the Church&rsquo;s tradition.</p></div>

This is an ongoing list, purely opinionated, and entirely meant as a catharsis of all the content that is covered in a PhD program, especially in the required first year sequence.</p></div>

      <h3><a href="/posts/review-socialist/">A Review of &#39;Can A Catholic Be A Socialist?&#39;</a>
      </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="post-content"><div class="p_part"><p>In many respects, democratic socialism was and is close to Catholic social doctrine, and has in any case made a remarkable contribution to the formation of a social consciousness. - Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger
 As a criticism of Catholic Socialism, Horn and Pakulak (H&amp;P) offer a thoroughly mediocre rebuttal. As a defense of capitalism as an economic system, H&amp;P offer an underwhelming picture. On the other hand, as an exemplar of current Republican polemics, H&amp;P give it to us, par excellence, with several chapters feeling as if they could have been lifted straight from a Glenn Beck book from when he still had a program on Fox News.</p></div>

        <h3>Textbook Reviews
        </h3>
        
        </div>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve often thought about doing a reivew of textbooks as I&rsquo;ve come across them, and looking back on the first year, I think that now is an opportune time to actually think about the books I&rsquo;ve read for my classes or research. This is an ongoing list, purely opinionated, and entirely meant as a catharsis of all the content that is covered in a PhD program, especially in the required first year sequence.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here they are:</p>
<h3 id="microeconomic-theory">Microeconomic Theory</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green: Microeconomic Theory</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Its size, weight, and small text are all more reminiscient of an encyclopedia than of the traditional textbook, and it aims to give a comprehensive foundation in microeconomics. On that count, it actually did succeed. Its content is such that anyone seeking to go through the entirety of it in a year will still find themselves pressed for time, and it contains sections on topics that I suspect aren&rsquo;t often covered (social choice functions, anyone?).</p>
<p>But with that said, I don&rsquo;t necessarily think that its coverage of all of the topics is necessarily the best possible coverage, although I would be hard pressed to describe it as a fun read. I think that the game theory section, especially the sections on signaling and screening somehow leave something to be desired, although it&rsquo;s hard for me to explain why. On the whole, I&rsquo;d recommend this to anyone who wants to really get to understand the nature of a first year graduate sequence in microeconomics or just to have as a general reference if you&rsquo;re not going to specialize in microeconomics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kreps: A Course In Microeconomic Theory</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m going to be honest, I only really engaged with this book in the beginning, as a reference for classical microeconomic theory. With that said, I was very pleased with it, as it remains somehow decently readable for a textbook and I have a preference for the way in which Kreps introduces preference relations as acyclical and negatively transitive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Krishna: Auction Theory</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to do auctions or mechanisms, a must buy. Relatively thin, readable, jam packed with results, intuitive and elegant proofs, and suggestions for further research. Best use of money in grad school so far.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Osborne and Rubinstein: A Course in Game Theory</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps a bit technical, but honestly, I have no real complaints about it besides it being a bit of a dense read. I really appreciated how in their discussions of repeated games they covered multiple ways of thinking about the value of an infinitely repeated game. A must get if you are going to be a game theorist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Varian: Microeconomic Analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>A bit of a snore. Good stuff on classical microeconomics and it is well edited (focused on getting the results to you quickly) but I have no reason to recommend this over Kreps or MWG and its my least favorite of the three to read.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="econometrics-probability-and-statistics">Econometrics, Probability, and Statistics</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pollard: A User&rsquo;s Guide to Measure Theoretic Probability</p>
<ul>
<li>I hate and love Pollard at the same time. He&rsquo;s a de Finetti partisan and it takes a while to get back into reading his book, every time. It&rsquo;s also an excellent book and highly useful for anyone who wants to get a feel for measure theoretic probability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hamilton: Time Series Analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t touched much of it so far, but it&rsquo;s more of a reference manual than a textbook (not unlike MWG). Hamilton did a very good job in how comprehensive he is, so definitely worth a buy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Casella and Burger: Statistical Inference</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t like it at all. Something about the presentation of the material makes it feel like a Calc I textbook and honestly I just don&rsquo;t see what the big deal is about the book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hayashi: Econometrics</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m a Hayashi partisan. I would take a bullet for this textbook. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but the didactic approach of treating everything as a special case of GMMs is actually nice and helped me later think through the part of the course on M-estimators as I was already thinking about so many things as a special instance of something else. Highly recommend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="macroeconomics">Macroeconomics</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Acegmolu: Introduction to Modern Economic Growth</p>
<ul>
<li>Another textbook that&rsquo;s more reference manual than anything. Dense to read. Get it if you want to keep a reference around, but I doubt I&rsquo;m ever going to pick it up again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ljungqvist and Sargent: Recursive Macroeconomic Theory</p>
<ul>
<li>Pretty good, I guess. Sort of feel like this is a bit like a Kreps vibe to me but in macroeconomics, which I appreciate. Get this before Acemoglu.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gali: Monetary Policy, Inflation, and the Business Cycle</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s good. A little bit of a slow read, but hey, it&rsquo;s a textbook. Got me mildly excited about the business cycle and I don&rsquo;t do macro, so take that as a ringing endorsement. Don&rsquo;t think it does a great job explaining log linearization though.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

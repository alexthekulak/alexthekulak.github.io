      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve often thought about doing a reivew of textbooks as I&amp;rsquo;ve come across them, and looking back on the first year, I think that now is an opportune time to actually think about the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read for my classes or research. This is an ongoing list, purely opinionated, and entirely meant as a catharsis of all the content that is covered in a PhD program, especially in the required first year sequence.</description>

      <description>In many respects, democratic socialism was and is close to Catholic social doctrine, and has in any case made a remarkable contribution to the formation of a social consciousness. - Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger
 As a criticism of Catholic Socialism, Horn and Pakulak (H&amp;amp;P) offer a thoroughly mediocre rebuttal. As a defense of capitalism as an economic system, H&amp;amp;P offer an underwhelming picture. On the other hand, as an exemplar of current Republican polemics, H&amp;amp;P give it to us, par excellence, with several chapters feeling as if they could have been lifted straight from a Glenn Beck book from when he still had a program on Fox News.</description>
